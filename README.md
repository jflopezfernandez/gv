In its current form, the application still does not yet implement genetic algorithm functionality. So far, the application simply simulates a Markov chain of Brownian motion, with the user configuring the number of iterations to simulate. The output is currently formatted to be compatible with the [GNU plotutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/) software package, allowing the user to use the simulation's output as input for the `graph` utility.

There is a sample simulation in the `data` folder, as well as the postscript and portable-network graphics files generated by `graph`. The latter looks like this:

The application remains under development, and additional functionality is still being both planned and implemented.
